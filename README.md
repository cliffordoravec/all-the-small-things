## Known Issues

## Roadmap

I created this watch face for my own personal use, therefore there isn't much of an emphasis on customization at the moment.

Should people find this watch face useful and want to see configurable options for things such as colors or data fields, those might be things I add support for.

But at the moment, what you see is what you get.
